Choose an input from Really quiet and seems like it handles the large space really well. I have it in an open plan kitchen, dining and family room and it is very reactive to smoke and odours. Even when doors are opened, it senses the changes and the orange and even red led lights up and fan increases to counteract the changes in conditions. Very happy after a few weeks, will monitor to see if it continues. Noticeably less allergy symptoms inside the house, even with the dog mainly indoors and constantly malting, large German shepherd, so very happy with the change it has brought about!,I'm very happy with this air purifier. I have a cat and it visibly picks up a lot of hair, that must just be floating around in the air; hair that would normally go unnoticed. I started using a Levoit LV-PUR 131 machine a couple of years ago to remove the smell of vaped marijuana flower (prescribed medical). I love the smell myself, but I know how many don't, and I'm a considerate neighbour. I've had the Winix for 3 months now, and it is far superior to the Levoit model, which has now been demoted to hallway duties. I like the washable pre-filter, although I've not actually had to wash it yet. I find that a good going over with a vacuum once a week, to remove all the large debris, is enough. I vacuum the charcoal filter too. As I've said, my primary reason for using an air purifier was never to remove dust but this is a big bonus, and there is visibly less dust now. The sensor detects VOCs much better than smoke, and for anyone using it for smoke or weed should be aware of this. I just keep it on setting three most of the time, which works very well for cigarette smoke and marijuana vape. Setting 3 on the Winix is quieter than setting 1 on the Levoit. Setting 3 is my \"go to\" setting. It's really not noisy at all. For smoke, leaving it on \"auto\" doesn't work, but manually setting it to 3 does. The same is true of marijuana flower vape. The turbo mode (4th speed) is VERY loud but unnecessary for normal use. I occasionally give it a blast, just to clear the air quickly, and it's very effective for this. I have a large living room, and 10 minutes on turbo will just clear anything quickly. The one niggle I have is that when I want to leave it on, as I retire to bed, I have a practical choice of setting 3 for 4 hours, or turbo for an hour - the timer does 1, 4 or 8 hours. It would be more useful for my purposes, if I could choose 1, 2, and 4 hours. Ideally, I'd like to be able to leave it on setting 3 for 2 hours, but that's not possible. I leave the Plasmawave mode on because on or off, I don't notice any difference. People have talked about it making occasional snapping noises, but I've never heard anything. Unbranded filter sets are about 20 quid, so in practice, I change them every two months. Winix say the charcoal filter will last for a lot longer as it is washable, but TBH washing and drying is too much faff for me. Lastly... it LOOKS better than the Levoit, which has turned yellow from UV light, like many white/off-white plastics. I'm very happy with this Winix machine. From research and experience, I now think that it's probably the best in the UK home market, for smoke and vape. I'm still very happy with the performance. I've discovered that because I've been smoking rollies (tobacco) near the unit, a sticky film develops on the pre-filter. In fact, the surrounding black plastic is also sticky. I think it's nicotine. Anyway, I just laid the filter down in the bath, and went gently over it with some water and a little washing up liquid. This did the trick. Good as new. Another trick I've found is that the carbon filter is exactly half the depth of the Hepa filter, so it is possible to fit three carbon filters, and no Hepa filter. Of course, from the POV of smoke and vape removal, this is not, as one might think, three times the effectiveness, but rather 197% the smoke-reducing power (according to ChatGPT) - something to do with layer passing. That's still almost twice as effective. It doesn't get the fine dust through, that's just blown back into the room. I use this air purifier in the room where I smoke and vape. Just around the corner, in my hallway, I have another Winix with a Hepa filter. That one gets the dust.",

Breville is the kitchen appliance brand that delivers innovation based on consumer insights, empowering people’s potential to do things more impressively or easily than they’d thought possible in their own kitchen.,I couldn't work out from reading how it would connect to the app, WiFi or Bluetooth. Nowhere does it mention the type of connection on the box, manual etc. Just downloaded the app and connected after some fiddling with the app settings. Not the easiest way to connect but it is 2.4g WiFi. It works well for double bed sized rooms and we have them sitting atop bedside tables so they're not picking up carpet fibres filling the filters too quickly, carpets get vacuumed weekly, and we are more worried about the airborne dust anyway. that is not a Customer review or feedback but more of product info/description.",

Off-brand filters are inconsistent, unreliable, and may damage the air purifier. Validate before displaying - Choose an input from This Levoit air purifier has been one of my best purchases in a long time. I have mild allergies and used to feel unwell after spending long hours in a closed room with limited airflow. After getting this, the difference has been huge — I feel noticeably better and get sick far less often. The purifier runs almost all the time when I’m home, and it’s surprisingly low-maintenance. The mobile app is excellent — you can set schedules to automatically turn it on or off. For example, mine switches off when I leave for work and turns back on before I get home, so the air is already clean when I walk in. The filter really works — after just a week, you can see how much dust it has trapped. It’s also compact and portable; I even took it with me on a trip to Dubai and packed it easily in my luggage. For a small bedroom or apartment, this model is perfect. It’s a bit loud on full power (sounds like a high-end PC fan), but you can use sleep mode if you prefer it quiet. I personally keep it on high most of the time for stronger airflow and faster purification. Overall, this product has genuinely improved my indoor air quality and health, and I’m now a big fan of the Levoit brand. I’ll definitely be buying a higher-capacity model in the future. Highly recommend this one for anyone dealing with dust or allergies.,This is a great little bedroom air purifier its quiet and non intrusive, the sound you can hear is like white noise so it doesn't interfere with falling asleep. It has 3 speed settings so its very easy to use. The ordering process was very easy and it was delivered before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition. As I have only just started using it I have no comment on the filter system but I have high hopes as it did have excellent reviews which did help me to choose this product, plus it was at a good price too.",

    "description": "Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life is a beautifully written and insightful book that explores the Japanese concept of ikigai, which translates to \"a reason for being.\" This book delves into how embracing this philosophy can lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life, offering both wisdom and practical advice for finding your own ikigai. The book is easy to read, with a thoughtful structure that weaves together stories, insights, and lessons from Japan’s culture and philosophy. The writing is clear, engaging, and accessible, making it perfect for anyone interested in personal development or those looking to explore a new approach to happiness and well-being. What makes this book so appealing is its focus on the idea that finding purpose is a key ingredient to a long and happy life. Through interviews with centenarians from Okinawa (one of the world’s Blue Zones), where people live longer lives, the authors explore how the concept of ikigai plays a significant role in health, happiness, and longevity. The book highlights how having a sense of purpose not only enhances one’s mental and emotional health but also contributes to physical well-being. The authors also provide actionable steps on how readers can discover their own ikigai. It’s about aligning what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. This combination leads to a sense of fulfilment and direction that can significantly improve the quality of life. The book encourages reflection, helping you think about what brings joy and meaning to your life. Whether it’s your career, relationships, or personal hobbies, Ikigai provides a framework to help you integrate these aspects into your daily life, so you can live with more intention and passion. The exercises and practical tips on how to identify your ikigai are thoughtful and will inspire anyone looking to find more purpose in their life. Ikigai offers incredible value for anyone seeking inspiration or looking to live a more meaningful life. It’s an easy read that leaves you feeling motivated and thoughtful. The combination of Japanese philosophy and practical advice makes it an enriching experience that’s worth every penny. This book is perfect for anyone who wants to find more purpose in their life, whether you’re in the middle of your career, facing a life transition, or simply looking for ways to live with more intention. It’s especially valuable for people seeking balance, happiness, or longevity through mindful living. Overall, Ikigai is a heart-warming and practical guide to living a longer, happier, and more meaningful life. It encourages readers to slow down, reflect, and take small steps towards aligning their passions and purpose with their daily life. I highly recommend this book for anyone on the journey to self-discovery and personal fulfilment.",

      "description": "Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life is a beautifully written and insightful book that explores the Japanese concept of ikigai, which translates to \"a reason for being.\" This book delves into how embracing this philosophy can lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life, offering both wisdom and practical advice for finding your own ikigai. The book is easy to read, with a thoughtful structure that weaves together stories, insights, and lessons from Japan’s culture and philosophy. The writing is clear, engaging, and accessible, making it perfect for anyone interested in personal development or those looking to explore a new approach to happiness and well-being. What makes this book so appealing is its focus on the idea that finding purpose is a key ingredient to a long and happy life. Through interviews with centenarians from Okinawa (one of the world’s Blue Zones), where people live longer lives, the authors explore how the concept of ikigai plays a significant role in health, happiness, and longevity. The book highlights how having a sense of purpose not only enhances one’s mental and emotional health but also contributes to physical well-being. The authors also provide actionable steps on how readers can discover their own ikigai. It’s about aligning what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. This combination leads to a sense of fulfilment and direction that can significantly improve the quality of life. The book encourages reflection, helping you think about what brings joy and meaning to your life. Whether it’s your career, relationships, or personal hobbies, Ikigai provides a framework to help you integrate these aspects into your daily life, so you can live with more intention and passion. The exercises and practical tips on how to identify your ikigai are thoughtful and will inspire anyone looking to find more purpose in their life. Ikigai offers incredible value for anyone seeking inspiration or looking to live a more meaningful life. It’s an easy read that leaves you feeling motivated and thoughtful. The combination of Japanese philosophy and practical advice makes it an enriching experience that’s worth every penny. This book is perfect for anyone who wants to find more purpose in their life, whether you’re in the middle of your career, facing a life transition, or simply looking for ways to live with more intention. It’s especially valuable for people seeking balance, happiness, or longevity through mindful living. Overall, Ikigai is a heart-warming and practical guide to living a longer, happier, and more meaningful life. It encourages readers to slow down, reflect, and take small steps towards aligning their passions and purpose with their daily life. I highly recommend this book for anyone on the journey to self-discovery and personal fulfilment.",

Choose an input from The Winix 5520 deserves my rare 5-star rating. Everything about this is exactly what I expect. It just works. I set it up next to my 3D printer, and the difference in air quality is noticeable. PROS * It works - air is cleaned efficiently. * Aesthetically pleasing. * It is very quiet. * Setup was flawless and easy. * The unit's auto feature is accurate and trustworthy. * The replacement filters are a fair price, work well and can be trusted. CONS * The app used to control devices is only available for iOS and Android. Windows, Fire Tables, etc. are not available. In summary, I can personally recommend this product.,Nowhere in the product description does it say that this is a 120V product which most of the world does not use. I plugged it in uae and the unit got busted. Waste of hard earned money 845 dhs and wait time. Worse still no warranty in the UAE. Worldwide buyers be warned and stay AWAY from useless products like this. that is not a Customer review or feedback but more of product info/description.",

Choose an input from Really quiet and seems like it handles the large space really well. I have it in an open plan kitchen, dining and family room and it is very reactive to smoke and odours. Even when doors are opened, it senses the changes and the orange and even red led lights up and fan increases to counteract the changes in conditions. Very happy after a few weeks, will monitor to see if it continues. Noticeably less allergy symptoms inside the house, even with the dog mainly indoors and constantly malting, large German shepherd, so very happy with the change it has brought about!,I'm very happy with this air purifier. I have a cat and it visibly picks up a lot of hair, that must just be floating around in the air; hair that would normally go unnoticed. I started using a Levoit LV-PUR 131 machine a couple of years ago to remove the smell of vaped marijuana flower (prescribed medical). I love the smell myself, but I know how many don't, and I'm a considerate neighbour. I've had the Winix for 3 months now, and it is far superior to the Levoit model, which has now been demoted to hallway duties. I like the washable pre-filter, although I've not actually had to wash it yet. I find that a good going over with a vacuum once a week, to remove all the large debris, is enough. I vacuum the charcoal filter too. As I've said, my primary reason for using an air purifier was never to remove dust but this is a big bonus, and there is visibly less dust now. The sensor detects VOCs much better than smoke, and for anyone using it for smoke or weed should be aware of this. I just keep it on setting three most of the time, which works very well for cigarette smoke and marijuana vape. Setting 3 on the Winix is quieter than setting 1 on the Levoit. Setting 3 is my \"go to\" setting. It's really not noisy at all. For smoke, leaving it on \"auto\" doesn't work, but manually setting it to 3 does. The same is true of marijuana flower vape. The turbo mode (4th speed) is VERY loud but unnecessary for normal use. I occasionally give it a blast, just to clear the air quickly, and it's very effective for this. I have a large living room, and 10 minutes on turbo will just clear anything quickly. The one niggle I have is that when I want to leave it on, as I retire to bed, I have a practical choice of setting 3 for 4 hours, or turbo for an hour - the timer does 1, 4 or 8 hours. It would be more useful for my purposes, if I could choose 1, 2, and 4 hours. Ideally, I'd like to be able to leave it on setting 3 for 2 hours, but that's not possible. I leave the Plasmawave mode on because on or off, I don't notice any difference. People have talked about it making occasional snapping noises, but I've never heard anything. Unbranded filter sets are about 20 quid, so in practice, I change them every two months. Winix say the charcoal filter will last for a lot longer as it is washable, but TBH washing and drying is too much faff for me. Lastly... it LOOKS better than the Levoit, which has turned yellow from UV light, like many white/off-white plastics. I'm very happy with this Winix machine. From research and experience, I now think that it's probably the best in the UK home market, for smoke and vape. I'm still very happy with the performance. I've discovered that because I've been smoking rollies (tobacco) near the unit, a sticky film develops on the pre-filter. In fact, the surrounding black plastic is also sticky. I think it's nicotine. Anyway, I just laid the filter down in the bath, and went gently over it with some water and a little washing up liquid. This did the trick. Good as new. Another trick I've found is that the carbon filter is exactly half the depth of the Hepa filter, so it is possible to fit three carbon filters, and no Hepa filter. Of course, from the POV of smoke and vape removal, this is not, as one might think, three times the effectiveness, but rather 197% the smoke-reducing power (according to ChatGPT) - something to do with layer passing. That's still almost twice as effective. It doesn't get the fine dust through, that's just blown back into the room. I use this air purifier in the room where I smoke and vape. Just around the corner, in my hallway, I have another Winix with a Hepa filter. That one gets the dust.",

Off-brand filters are inconsistent, unreliable, and may damage the air purifier. Validate before displaying - Choose an input from This Levoit air purifier has been one of my best purchases in a long time. I have mild allergies and used to feel unwell after spending long hours in a closed room with limited airflow. After getting this, the difference has been huge — I feel noticeably better and get sick far less often. The purifier runs almost all the time when I’m home, and it’s surprisingly low-maintenance. The mobile app is excellent — you can set schedules to automatically turn it on or off. For example, mine switches off when I leave for work and turns back on before I get home, so the air is already clean when I walk in. The filter really works — after just a week, you can see how much dust it has trapped. It’s also compact and portable; I even took it with me on a trip to Dubai and packed it easily in my luggage. For a small bedroom or apartment, this model is perfect. It’s a bit loud on full power (sounds like a high-end PC fan), but you can use sleep mode if you prefer it quiet. I personally keep it on high most of the time for stronger airflow and faster purification. Overall, this product has genuinely improved my indoor air quality and health, and I’m now a big fan of the Levoit brand. I’ll definitely be buying a higher-capacity model in the future. Highly recommend this one for anyone dealing with dust or allergies.,This is a great little bedroom air purifier its quiet and non intrusive, the sound you can hear is like white noise so it doesn't interfere with falling asleep. It has 3 speed settings so its very easy to use. The ordering process was very easy and it was delivered before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition. As I have only just started using it I have no comment on the filter system but I have high hopes as it did have excellent reviews which did help me to choose this product, plus it was at a good price too.",

      "description": "ICU-grade filtration. Certified by SITRA - HIVE uses HEPA H14 filters - the highest global standard for air purification. It traps 99.99% of airborne pollutants, including viruses, bacteria, allergens, and ultra-fine particles as small as 0.015 microns. This is the same clean air standard used in ICU cleanrooms - and HIVE is one of the only purifiers in India to be clinically certified to deliver it. Proven to reduce respiratory symptoms - In real-world use, HIVE has helped reduce asthma attacks, chronic cough, and medication use. Families across India - including homes with children and the elderly - have reported breathing easier and sleeping better after switching to HIVE. Cleans a room in minutes - HIVE is engineered to rapidly purify spaces up to 345 sq ft - faster than most premium purifiers on the market. Whether it’s your bedroom, clinic, classroom, or workspace, it gets to work instantly and keeps your air clean all day, automatically. Real-time tracking of your air, not just AQI - HIVE continuously monitors PM2.5, VOCs, carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, and even ambient noise. You can view everything on the OLED display or in the app. It not only cleans your air, but also helps you understand it. No gimmicks. Just pure, focused performance - Unlike lifestyle purifiers that double as fans or humidifiers, HIVE is built with one goal: delivering hospital-grade air quality. No unnecessary features. No distractions. Just protection that performs. Aircraft-grade build quality. Silent and lasting - Most purifiers use plastic. HIVE is machined from aerospace-grade aluminum for durability and a premium finish. It runs silently, blends into your interiors, and lasts for years, not seasons. Designed and built in India. Supported locally - HIVE is built entirely in-house by Praan in Mumbai - from R&D to final assembly. That means faster service, smarter innovation, and complete transparency. It’s proudly Indian, and trusted by global tech leaders and health professionals alike.. Choose an input from Clean air, down to the last molecule HIVE is India’s first AI-powered, medical-grade and clinically certified air purifier that purifies the air you breathe with the same technology used in ICU cleanrooms. It captures particles as small as 0.015 microns - including viruses, bacteria, allergens, and pollution that most purifiers miss - with certified HEPA H14 filtration. It senses what’s in the air, adapts in real time, and shows you exactly what you’re breathing through real-time data on PM1, PM2.5, CO₂, VOCs, and more - so you always know your air is safe. It works silently and adjusts automatically. HIVE is engineered from aerospace-grade aluminum, not plastic. It’s designed to last for years, not seasons. It fits seamlessly into your home - wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, or free-standing - with no compromise on coverage or speed. It’s also fast. HIVE can clean an average room in under 10 minutes. Unlike lifestyle purifiers that do a little of everything, HIVE focuses on one thing - pure, medical-grade air. It’s been clinically tested, trusted by leading doctors, and has helped children and adults reduce asthma and allergy symptoms across India. Designed in India. Built for real performance. Backed by real impact.",

I also suffer from seasonal allergies and mild asthma. Between pollen from open windows, and general city dust, I was constantly sneezing, congested, and needing to dust every other day. I needed a solution for my main living area/bedroom. After extensive research, I picked this model because of its True HEPA H13 filter (captures 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns), its CADR rating suited for my room size, and the inclusion of a dedicated activated carbon filter for odors. I was skeptical that an air purifier could make such a dramatic difference. I am now a total believer. This unit has significantly improved my daily comfort, my sleep quality, and my overall health. It feels like an investment in our well-being. Who is this for? Allergy sufferers, pet owners, city dwellers, people sensitive to smells, or anyone who just wants to breathe cleaner air in their personal space. Highly, highly recommended. It does exactly what it promises, efficiently and quietly. Worth every penny. ",

      "name": "Dreo 11L Smart Humidifier Large Room 700 ft², 100H Cool Mist Air Humidifiers for Bedroom, Top-Fill Self-Cleaning Tank, 26dB, Auto Mode, Aroma Box, RGB Light, Remote & APP Control, Baby, Plant, Blue",
      "description": "This humidifier has a sleek and modern design, with two lightweight sections divided by a silver band, all secured to a pedestal base with a twist lock and screw. • The flat lid has a 360-degree rotatable mist nozzle that is angled at 30 degrees. You can change the direction, but not the angle. • The lid features a protruding finger tab for easy removal. • Underneath the lid is a large water collection area with a centrally located mister. • It has drainage slots on one side that direct water into the main reservoir (which holds up to 11 liters or 2.96 gallons). • The top section houses the motor and a 5-ft polarized electrical cord, and it easily lifts off for cleaning. • The bottom section contains a simple water draw tube with an attached round water filter that is easy to replace. • Other than some plastic guides for water flow, the bottom reservoir is mostly empty. • The unit includes a rear aroma tray with removable absorbent material if you want to add fragrance. • Base dimensions: 10 inches wide × 8 inches deep • Height: 31 inches from floor to lid • Circumference: 23 inches • Max power usage: 32 watts • Water weight (full): ~24 lbs • Unit weight (empty): ~6 lbs • Handles? No, but it’s easy to move when it’s not full. I won’t go into deep technical details—you can download the user manual under “Product Guides and Documents” on the Amazon page. However, I will note: • Auto Mode: Whisper quiet • Highest setting (Level 3): Not bad in terms of noise, but audible. • App Integration: The Dreo app syncs first via Bluetooth, then WiFi only for Google and Alexa support. • Voice Control: You can control most features and scheduling through the app or with voice commands. • Alexa: Can tell you the humidity setting but not the current humidity level (this is an Alexa limitation, not a Dreo issue). • Google Assistant: Can provide both the humidity setting and current room humidity when asked: o Example: “Hey Google, what is the humidifier humidity level?” o If you named your device “humidifier,” Google will give you the correct response. • Important Note: This issue happens with other smart devices too. Alexa simply does not support reporting humidity levels, while Google does. One reviewer mentioned white dust buildup, which happens with humidifiers using hard water or well water. Solution? Use: ✅ Distilled water ✅ Refrigerator-filtered water ✅ Demineralized water I personally use my refrigerator's filtered water and have zero white dust issues. I placed my humidifier in the middle of my living room, set the humidity goal to 65%, and went to bed. • Starting humidity: 22% • Morning humidity: 52% o (It didn’t reach 65% because my house leaks too much air, which would cost thousands to fix.) I primarily bought this humidifier to: ✅ Improve humidity for my houseplants ✅ Stop itchy, dry skin It works perfectly for both. If I needed another humidifier, I would buy this exact model again. Dreo did an excellent job with the design, functionality, and smart features. Highly recommended. Hope this review helps someone! Edit: Three points: 1. The reservoir tank is one solid floor of plastic which cannot leak, however if you fill excessively beyond the outside marked max water line, as seen on the front, the overfill will leak from the top backside. 2. The Dreco app gives you full control over the unit except it doesn't provide a remaining water level gauge. That's because the remaining water level is only read visually from the front outside. 3. You can turn the unit ON or OFF by voice (Alexa/Google) or in combination with the app or by a schedule. The schedule could be made on Alexa or on Google home or in the Dreco app, it all works. 4. This unit doesn't provide any more white dust, than any other humidifier. White dust is simply excessive minerals, (total dissolve solids TDS) in the water. Again I use refrigerator filtered water which has total dissolved solids around 109 ppm. I liked the humidifier so much that I bought another identical one. My plants are happy and I don't scratch.",

      "description": "INDOOR AIR POLLUTION - EPA estimates that indoor air can be as much as 5 TIMES more polluted than the air outdoors. If you suffer from fatigue, headaches, congestion, or sneezing, you may be exposed to poor air quality conditions at home. PURIFY XL AREA UP TO 2,002 SQ FT – When you breathe, you may unwittingly be inhaling billions of pollutants that cannot be seen with the naked eye. OxyPure Zero has been proven to effectively purify a 1000 sq. ft room twice per hour and a 2002 sq. ft room once per hour. INTERTEK LAB CERTIFIED – Zero captures up to 100% of airborne particle pollutants as small as 0.1 microns including smoke, dust, and pollen. It can also remove airborne irritants such as pet hair, harmful chemicals, and ozone. DUAL 4-STAGE FILTERATION – The stainless-steel prefilter captures large particles. The ozone emission removal filter eliminates toxic ozone. 2 patented Bio-Guard Filters & the Bio-Guard 360 Filter remove harmful airborne particle pollutants and odors. REVOLUTIONARY FILTERATION TECHNOLOGY – Just like the vacuum cleaners did away with paper filters, so does the OxyPure Zero. The ultra-effective Bio-Guard filters are washable and reusable meaning ZERO waste and ZERO filter replacements. CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD CERTIFIED – OxyPure Zero meets the stringent California ozone emissions limit. It eliminates toxic Ozone in the home to less than 1 part per billion (ppb), about 70 times less than the EPA’s designated safe level of 70 ppb. ENERGY STAR CERTIFIED – Even when operating 24/7, the annual electricity cost is minimal! Check with your local utility company to determine if a portion of the purchase qualifies for a rebate. It is also ETL certified.. Choose an input from This is the best investment in a home appliance I’ve ever used and worth every penny- so easy to clean, I never have to buy new filters because it’s washable, the fan speed options are perfect (turbo mode is the best). I have really bad allergies and all I need to do is turn this on for about 5-10 minutes and it clears everything out to leave clean fresh air. Super easy to set up too, we didn’t have to assemble anything plus it’s on wheels so you can roll it from room to room. We even used this when there was a bad wildfire nearby to prevent smoke from contaminating our air quality. Another huge plus is that it actually REMOVES ODOR from the air AND CLEANS AIR at the same time. I have been using for over a year and now I am considering buying a 2nd unit to put into the basement to get rid of that stuffy smell. Highly recommended!!! Don’t waste your money on the cheap ones, this is your best bet.,The Nuwave OxyPure Zero is the Best Air Purifier I've ever owned with more valuable health protecting filters than Baskin-Robbins has flavors of ice cream. No need to buy filters for at least 10 years, and many last forever. You clean filters manually every 3 to 6 months. Very important is that it also filters out harmful Ozone which many purifiers do not. This is a very high quality built unit. Respect it. It has a strong fan if you need it. It has a night or sleep mode that turns off all the indicator lights when you are sleeping, but the unit is still operating. This unit is best - and very convenient - to operate using your CELL Phone. This is dope! I leave the cell phone next to my bed at night if needed. You can be at the shopping mall and turn on your unit at home and adjust the settings. Watching TV at night and want to prepare the bedroom 30 minutes before? - No problem, use your phone. It also has manual controls. It might take some time to link the Nuwave to your Cell Phone, but it's worth the time. It has many operating modes. I use the Ultimate Clean most of the time. It has a timer and many other features. I love this unit and I could not imagine a better purifier. You can also adjust where you want the air to blow with the electronic angle adjuster. It has alerts on when to change the filter. It also has sniffer sensors and filters out BAD Odors. I have a large bedroom and this is where I use the unit. I have never had a URI, allergy attack, or got sick since I used this in my bedroom -- and I used to get these every 2 months. MAKE SURE YOU READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS FOR THIS UNIT BEFORE USING. BE CAREFUL HANDLING FILTERS. THIS UNIT IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

In the middle of deadlines, targets, and daily routines, this book is a gentle reminder to pause and reflect on one essential question: What is my reason for being? Ikigai isn’t just a concept — it’s a way of living with purpose, passion, and balance. Looking forward to discovering insights that can help both personally and professionally — especially in navigating work-life balance, mindful living, and meaningful contribution. Excited for the journey ahead 📘🌿,Ikigai is one of those best books that makes you pause and think about how you’re really living your life. I picked it up at a time when everything around me felt dart, and this book honestly helped me slow down. It’s based on a simple but powerful Japanese concept - ikigai, which roughly means “a reason for being.” The authors travel to Okinawa, Japan, known for having some of the world’s oldest and happiest people, and they explore what keeps them so active and content even in their 90s and 100s. The stories of these people — gardening daily, cooking for neighbors, laughing with friends — sound so ordinary, yet that’s exactly what makes the book special. It shows how joy hides in small, consistent things. What I liked most is that it doesn’t try to preach. It mixes science, philosophy, and real human stories in a simple way. A few chapters felt a bit repetitive, but overall the message stayed with me: don’t chase happiness, build it slowly through purpose and routine. Since reading Ikigai, I’ve started taking short evening walks and spending time doing things I actually enjoy — not just the ones that look productive. It’s amazing how much lighter life feels when you follow your own rhythm.",

      "description": "I ordered this Honeywell air purifier from Amazon, it arrived on December 11, 2025, and from the very first time I plugged it in, it was completely useless. The display immediately flashes AQ1 at 500 (the maximum reading) and stays locked there no matter what—clean room, open window, fan on high, nothing changes it. It just mindlessly blows room-temperature air around like a cheap desk fan and then randomly shuts itself off after a few minutes. This thing doesn’t purify air; it’s a $200+ plastic brick that pretends to. I immediately contacted Amazon for a replacement—basic expectation when you receive a defective product, right? Wrong. The agent told me there are “no replacements available” (shocker), but I could get a full refund once the item is returned. Fine. They scheduled a pickup for December 16th. Guess what? Nobody showed up. No driver, no notification, nothing. I log into the Amazon app and it now says “Delivery Rejected” (for a pickup!). Zero explanation, zero update, zero way to reschedule without starting the entire return process over. Trying to reach Amazon customer service after that is a joke. Days later, I still have a broken, expensive piece of junk sitting in my living room and Amazon is happily holding onto my money. This isn’t incompetence; this feels deliberate. Deliver obviously faulty units, charge full price, then throw up every possible roadblock to returns and refunds so customers eventually give up. Honeywell clearly doesn’t test or care about quality, and Amazon is enabling it with the worst post-sale support I’ve ever experienced. Save your money, your time, and your sanity—do NOT buy this Honeywell air purifier. And honestly, think twice before trusting Amazon with anything expensive anymore. Worst purchasing experience of my life. Zero stars if I could.. I am extremely disappointed with this Honeywell air purifier. The product I received is defective from day one. The AQI sensor is not working properly, and the readings are completely inaccurate. For a product that is supposed to ensure clean air and health, this is unacceptable. It is shocking that a reputed brand like Honeywell would allow such a faulty item to be shipped. This feels like fraud with customers—sending defective products without proper quality checks. I trusted the brand and ended up wasting my money and time. Amazon and Honeywell must look into this seriously. I request a replacement or full refund immediately. No customer should suffer because of defective products being passed off as new. Highly disappointed. Not recommended at all.",

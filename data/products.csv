Excited for the journey ahead 📘🌿,Ikigai is one of those best books that makes you pause and think about how you’re really living your life. I picked it up at a time when everything around me felt dart, and this book honestly helped me slow down. It’s based on a simple but powerful Japanese concept - ikigai, which roughly means “a reason for being.” The authors travel to Okinawa, Japan, known for having some of the world’s oldest and happiest people, and they explore what keeps them so active and content even in their 90s and 100s. The stories of these people — gardening daily, cooking for neighbors, laughing with friends — sound so ordinary, yet that’s exactly what makes the book special. It shows how joy hides in small, consistent things. What I liked most is that it doesn’t try to preach. It mixes science, philosophy, and real human stories in a simple way. A few chapters felt a bit repetitive, but overall the message stayed with me: don’t chase happiness, build it slowly through purpose and routine. Since reading Ikigai, I’ve started taking short evening walks and spending time doing things I actually enjoy — not just the ones that look productive. It’s amazing how much lighter life feels when you follow your own rhythm.",MyMirror Publishing House Pvt.
